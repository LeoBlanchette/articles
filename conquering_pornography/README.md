![She hunts you for them.](images/demonic_seduction.png)

A man's most powerful enemy is not another man. It is a woman. 

I didn't make this up. It is a concept shown plainly in the scriptures: 

### 📖 Scriptures on the Power and Danger of Temptation – KJV

> **Proverbs 7:26**  
> *"For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her."*

> **Proverbs 5:3–5**  
> *"For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:*  
> *But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.*  
> *Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell."*

> **Proverbs 6:24–26**  
> *"To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.*  
> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.*  
> *For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life."*

> **Ecclesiastes 7:26**  
> *"And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands:  
> whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her."*

> **Judges 16:15–21** *(summary)*  
> *The story of Delilah and Samson—how she wore him down and betrayed him, leading to the fall of Israel’s strongest man.*

Besides these accounts, remember King David's temptation with women, which led to an extreme amount of trouble in his house. He too was a great warrior, but Satan could easily humilate him through his own lust. 

## The Beginnings of Seduction 

"There is nothing new under the sun" is a favorite line of Christian teachers. And it is true. 

When the ancient fallen angels wished to destroy men, they started with witchcraft and lust: 

> Enoch 8:1,2 [8:1] And Azâzêl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals 〈of the earth〉 and the art of working them, **and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures. [8:2] And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways.** Semjâzâ taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, Armârôs the resolving of enchantments, Barâqîjâl, (taught) astrology, Kôkabêl the constellations, Ezêqêêl the knowledge of the clouds, 〈Araqiêl the signs of the earth, Shamsiêl the signs of the sun〉, and Sariêl the course of the moon. And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven . . .

### 🕊️ Seduction, Sorcery, and the War for Souls

**The war against human souls started with seduction and fornication. It remains the greatest enemy of most Christians today.**

You can observe a pattern in the Scriptures: there is a strong connection between **prostitution** and **witchcraft**. **Jezebel** was both a witch and a prostitute. When Jehu came to confront her, she immediately painted her eyes in an attempt to alter the course of events.

> **2 Kings 9:30 (KJV)**  
> *“And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.”*

This symbolic act wasn’t just vanity—it was a form of manipulation, a last attempt at control through allure. In the biblical imagination, painting the eyes becomes a ritual of rebellion, a performance of false power.

> **Revelation 2:20 (KJV)**  
> *"Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols."*

Jezebel, both as a historical figure and an enduring archetype, reveals the spiritual cost of seductive idolatry. This war is no less real now than it was in the days of kings and prophets—but today.


## A Fresh Perspective on the Nature of Your Calling 

This world at present is full of the temptations of seduction. Later, it will be a physical fight to blood, as it was for the ancient Christians. But for now, the fight is allurement. It is just as deadly as being thrown to the lions -- except in this case, men are jumping into the Lion's mouths.

If a person cannot subject his own flesh, he cannot be entrusted with subjecting nations--that is part of our Christian calling. This is why the Scriptures contain so many examples of this very matter:
A common pattern--**a man's involvement with lust disrupts his kingdom**. 

## How Can You Conquer the Desires of Lust?

"Pornography" isn't the entire issue. It is lust. Pornography is just a convenient vehicle for lust. 

For Christians who keep struggling, and asking about this, here are the steps to conquer pornography. Some you know, some you do not. 

### Prayer

This thing is in your flesh. It cannot be conquered by you alone. Asking the Lord for help in this—to actually take away the desire and to see the evil—is something you must do. God's inspiration is necessary to remove this desire.

### Spiritual Association (Your "Church")

Surprise: **some churches actually encourage the desires of lust.** Most people are unaware of the pagan associations of their churches, and the principalities of darkness have free access to its members. So lust is not removed, it is inflamed. Not only do women of modern churches dress themselves to seduce, but the affiliations of many customs (pagan holidays masquerading as "Christian holidays") are actually from the ancient Nicolaitans.

This is why demonic spirits are allowed free entry into many "Christians".

### Spiritual Association - The Demonic 

![Demonic Association](images/hellish.png)

It is very likely that **pornography** has tied a number of **demons** to you. Yes, it is real. The desire for this habit also comes from the **demonic affiliation** it has. Once a person becomes addicted, a **feedback loop of demonic influence** is created as he gives the **powers of evil** more control, and more control, and more control over him through this **snare**.

So you must actually acknowledge this and **pray for the Lord to expel the devils** you've invited into your body.

The Lord will deliver you, if you acknowledge the **sin** and desire to remove yourself from it. Then the **devils** will be forced to depart. Sometimes it is physically **noticeable** when they do leave.

Most **Christians** do not know this: A **demon** cannot enter a person without **God's permission**. Also, they leave by **His order**.
