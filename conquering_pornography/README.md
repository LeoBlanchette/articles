![She hunts you for them.](images/demonic_seduction.png)

A man's most powerful enemy is not another man. It is a woman. 

I didn't make this up. It is a concept shown plainly in the scriptures: 

### ğŸ“– Scriptures on the Power and Danger of Temptation â€“ KJV

> **Proverbs 7:26**  
> *"For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her."*

> **Proverbs 5:3â€“5**  
> *"For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:*  
> *But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.*  
> *Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell."*

> **Proverbs 6:24â€“26**  
> *"To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.*  
> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.*  
> *For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life."*

> **Ecclesiastes 7:26**  
> *"And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands:  
> whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her."*

> **Judges 16:15â€“21** *(summary)*  
> *The story of Delilah and Samsonâ€”how she wore him down and betrayed him, leading to the fall of Israelâ€™s strongest man.*

Besides these accounts, remember King David's temptation with women, which led to an extreme amount of trouble in his house. He too was a great warrior, but Satan could easily humilate him through his own lust. 

## The Beginnings of the Evil of Seduction 

"There is nothing new under the sun" is a favorite line of Christian teachers. And it is true. 

When the ancient fallen angels wished to destroy men, they started with witchcraft and lust: 

> Enoch 8:1,2 [8:1] And AzÃ¢zÃªl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals ã€ˆof the earthã€‰ and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures. [8:2] And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. SemjÃ¢zÃ¢ taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, ArmÃ¢rÃ´s the resolving of enchantments, BarÃ¢qÃ®jÃ¢l, (taught) astrology, KÃ´kabÃªl the constellations, EzÃªqÃªÃªl the knowledge of the clouds, ã€ˆAraqiÃªl the signs of the earth, ShamsiÃªl the signs of the sunã€‰, and SariÃªl the course of the moon. And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven . . .

## A Fresh Perspective on the Nature of Your Calling 

This world at present is full of the temptations of seduction. Later, it will be a physical fight to the blood, as it was for the ancient Christians. But for now, the fight is allurement. It is just as deadly as being thrown to the lionsâ€”except in this case, you jump into the Lion's mouths.

Part of the test, however, has to do with fashioning you into a strong man.
The mostly forgotten, yet inspired book The Shepherd of Hermas explains this.
