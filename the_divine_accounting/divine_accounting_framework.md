**Core Summary: Divine Accounting Framework (Counted → Weighed → Divided)**

---

**1. Theological Core Premise**  
The Divine Accounting Model is derived from Daniel 5 (Mene, Tekel, Peres) and rigorously applied across key biblical judgment and stewardship parables. It presents a non-mystical, mathematical interpretation of divine judgment and inheritance using canonical weights and measures:

- **Mene (Counted)** = Value assigned (e.g., 10 minas, 10 kings)
- **Tekel (Weighed)** = Standard weight (used for testing adequacy)
- **Peres (Divided)** = Inheritance redistribution (stripping or reward)

This framework is descriptive (explaining scripture) and predictive (usable like a formula).

---

**2. Standardized Biblical Units Used**  
- **1 mina = 60 shekels**
- **1 shekel = 20 gerahs**
- **1 talent = 3,000 shekels**
- **Peres = 30 shekels = 0.5 mina**

This weight system is used to quantify stewardship and judgment with consistency, unlike speculative numerological approaches.

---

**3. Symbolic and Functional Mapping**
- **Minas (Luke 19)** and **horns (Revelation 13)** are parallel representations of delegated stewardship.
  - 10 minas = 10 kings = 10 horns = 600 shekels (each king receives 1 mina)
- **The Beast** in Revelation 13 is weighed and found wanting using the same structure as Belshazzar in Daniel 5:
  - **600** shekels (Counted)
  - **60** shekels (Weighed: 1 mina = divine standard)
  - **6** shekels (Divided: fractional judgment outcome or loss)

This aligns with **666** as a judgment number, not a mystical evil identifier.

---

**4. Divine Equation and Mechanics**
- **Step 1: Counted** – A steward is given an allotment (e.g., 10 minas = 600 shekels)
- **Step 2: Weighed** – A divine weight (Tekel = 60 shekels = 1 mina) is applied
- **Step 3: Divided** – A judgment outcome (Peres = 30 shekels) is enacted:
  - Either loss (unfaithful) or redistribution to the faithful

This formula is recursive across parables:
- **Belshazzar:** Mina-Tekel-Peres judgment → Kingdom divided
- **Beast:** 666 = same judgment value → 10 kings lose power in 1 hour
- **Minas (Luke 19):** Unfaithful servant loses mina → given to faithful one
- **Talents (Matthew 25):** Unprofitable servant loses everything → given to high-yield steward

---

**5. Core Insight**
All stewards are judged not merely by productivity but by **measured weight versus divine expectation**.
- **The righteous inherit what the wicked lose.**
- **Judgment is not annihilation but transfer of rule.**

God is an economist: divine judgment reallocates value, kingship, or authority from one steward to another.

---

**6. Asymmetry Between Parables**  
- **Daniel & Revelation:** Judgment patterns are **explicit**, righteous stewards are **implicit**
- **Jesus’ Parables:** Righteous/unrighteous outcomes are **explicit**, but weight units and formulas are **hidden**

They **complete** one another. The missing mechanics in one are revealed in the other.

---

**7. Related Scripture Cluster**
- Daniel 5: Mene, Tekel, Peres
- Luke 19: 10 minas (stewardship pattern)
- Matthew 25: Talents + Sheep & Goats (redistribution, reward, and exile)
- Revelation 13 & 17: 666, 10 horns, Beast loses dominion
- Proverbs 11:1, Job 31:6, Amos 8:5: Weighing and just scales
- 1 Samuel 2:3 - "by Him actions are weighed"
- Revelation 6:5 - Scale judgment
- 1 Corinthians 3:13 - Each man’s work shall be revealed by fire

---

**8. Inheritance Division (Peres) Concept**
- **Peres = division of stewardship**
- Evil stewards lose their lot; faithful ones gain what was stripped
- Pattern of divine accounting ensures justice and equity across eternity

Examples:
- **Belshazzar → Kingdom given to Darius**
- **Beast → 10 kings lose rule in 1 hour**
- **Unfaithful servants → loss of minas/talents to productive ones**

---

**9. Defense Against Critics**
- Not numerology: All math uses **biblical weights** (Ezekiel standard)
- Not mysticism: All symbols explained through **scripture comparisons**
- Predictive: Model works across **multiple parables and prophecies**
- Built on **scriptural consistency**, not theological speculation
