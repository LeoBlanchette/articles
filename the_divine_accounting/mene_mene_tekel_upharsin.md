**A Divine Accounting Judgment: Daniel 5**

---

## Full Translation & Theological Meaning

These four Aramaic words appeared in Daniel 5:25 as mysterious writing on the wall during King Belshazzar's feast. Daniel interpreted them by divine insight, revealing a complete judgment formula.

---

### 1. **MENE (מְנֵא) – "Numbered"**

- **Literal Meaning**: A *mina*, or *"to number, count, assign"* (root: *manah*).
- **Repetition ("MENE MENE")**: Emphasizes finality and certainty. The count is complete.
- **Biblical Interpretation (Daniel 5:26)**:  
  > "God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it."
- **Implication**: Your stewardship has been fully evaluated. The end of your time is fixed.

**This represents the accounting or summing up of one’s rule or responsibilities.**

### 2. **TEKEL (תְּקֵל) – "Weighed"**

- **Literal Meaning**: A *shekel*, or *"to weigh, evaluate"* (root: *teqal*).
- **Cultural Context**: Ancient scales were used to weigh silver, goods, or deeds — a standard of judgment.
- **Biblical Interpretation (Daniel 5:27)**:  
  > "Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting."
- **Implication**: The individual has been measured morally or spiritually — and is found deficient.

**This symbolizes the evaluation of the steward’s worthiness or faithfulness.**

### 3. **UPHARSIN (וּפַרְסִין) – "Divided"**

- **Literal Meaning**: From *paras* — *to divide, break, split*.  
  *Upharsin* is a plural/conjunctive form; *Peres* is the singular used in Daniel’s explanation.
- **Wordplay**:
  - *Peres* sounds like *Paras* (Persians), indicating the kingdom will go to the Medes and Persians.
- **Biblical Interpretation (Daniel 5:28)**:  
  > "PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."

**This signifies the forfeiture of stewardship and the transfer of authority to another.**

## Modern Equivalent Summary

> **God has counted your stewardship, evaluated your value, and decreed that what you ruled will be broken and given to others.**

This phrase is the foundation of a divine judgment pattern — **Counted → Weighed → Divided** — found throughout Scripture in both judgment and reward parables (e.g., talents, minas, the beast, the righteous).

## Foundation for Divine Accounting Framework

- MENE: Entrusted resources and time.
- TEKEL: Judgment of value, productivity, or righteousness.
- UPHARSIN: Outcome — either inheritance or forfeiture, redistribution.

This threefold progression forms a predictable pattern, comparable to a spiritual law like **Ohm’s Law** in physics.
