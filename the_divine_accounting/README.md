# 666 Decoded: How Daniel's Judgment Formula Exposes the Beast 

This isn't numerology. It's divine accounting.
666 isn't a mystery number--it's a verdict. The Beast was judged with the same prophetic formula used on Belshazzar in Daniel 5. Here's how it all adds up.

## What You're About to Read:
This is a full breakdown of the **Counted** -> **Weighed** -> **Divided** system revealed in Daniel 5 and echoed in Revelation. Using consistent biblical weights (minas, shekels, gerahs), we show how *666 is not mystical*--it's a **prophetic accounting formula** tied to **divine judgment** and **inheritance**.
We'll demonstrate how the Beast is judged like Belshazzar, how the 10 horns match the 10 minas (600 Shekels), and how faithful stewards (**144,000**) inherit what is stripped from the wicked. 

## How to Count the Beast's Number

### The Puzzle

> **Revelation 13:18**  
> Here is **wisdom**. Let him that **hath understanding** count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is **Six hundred threescore and six**.

**Operative phrases:** "him that hath understanding" and "count".  

This directly connects to Daniel 5:

> **Daniel 5:11**  
> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and **understanding and wisdom**, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him;

**Context appropriate?** Yes. Daniel is the "man who hath understanding".  
After referencing the account of Nebuchadnezzar (who became a beast), he proceeds to reveal the judgment formula:

> **Daniel 5:25-28**  
> And this is the writing that was written, Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin.  
> This is the interpretation of the thing:  
> **Mene**; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.  
> **Tekel**; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.  
> **Peres**; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

So the full judgment process is clearly shown:

| Mene Mene | Tekel | Upharsin |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Counted   | Weighed | Divided |

In Daniel 5, **"the man who hath understanding"** demonstrates how to **count the number**--just as Revelation 13:18 commands.

**Notice:** The actions are past-tense. Not "count, weigh, divide", but rather "count**ed**, weigh**ed**, divid**ed**". 

### The Framework 

### The Weights, Measures, and Monetary Standard

> **Ezekiel 45:12** - And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

From this, we learn the standard biblical weights:

- **1 Mina (Maneh) = 60 Shekels**  
- **1 Shekel = 20 Gerahs**

This is the foundational key for decoding 666. The number must be interpreted using these divine weights--not modern assumptions.

Look at the structure of the number of the Wild Beast: 

> Here is **wisdom**. Let him that **hath understanding** count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is **Six hundred threescore and six**.

That is: **600**, **60**, and **6**--not simply "666" as a lump sum.  
The original language preserved this separation, and so should we.  
While both add to the same total, the separation is intentional and meaningful.

> **Note on the Greek Text:**  
> The phrase **"six hundred threescore and six"** in Revelation 13:18 is rendered in the original Greek as *hexakosioi hexekonta hex* — **three distinct cardinal terms** for *600*, *60*, and *6*. This is not a compact numeral (e.g. `χξϛ` = 666), but a deliberate, **tripartite construction**.  
>  
> The separation is textual, not interpretive. This precision implies a structural breakdown and invites analysis along those divisions. Since our model depends on the integrity of the Counted -> Weighed -> Divided formula, this linguistic partition is **foundational, not optional**.


Since the evidence is strong that this scripture (Revelation 13:18) is pointing back to the judgment scene in Daniel 5,  we can confidently conclude that this is another instance of **Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin**--a divine audit rendered in prophetic weights.

### Base Shekel Totals for Each Judgment

| Judgment Scene (in Shekels)       | Mene (Numbered) | Tekel (Weighed) | Peres (Divided) |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Daniel 5 (Belshazzar)**        | 60              | 1               | 30               |
| **Revelation 13 (The Beast)**    | 600             | 60              | 6                |
        
### How These Shekel Weights Are Calculated

- **Mene** is a **mina**, and according to Ezekiel 45:12, **1 mina = 60 shekels**.
- **Tekel** is a **shekel**--so its value is simply **1 shekel**.
- **Peres (Upharsin)** means "divided," and is interpreted as **half a mina**, which is **30 shekels**.

In Revelation, the Beast's number is given as **600 + 60 + 6**, matching the same structure:
- **600 shekels = 10 minas**
- **60 shekels = 1 mina**
- **6 shekels** as a final divided value

These values use the consistent biblical weight standard from Ezekiel 45:12.

### Hidden Meanings in Gerahs

If we convert all values to **gerahs**, the hidden meanings start to manifest.

Remember:

- **1 shekel = 20 gerahs**
- Therefore:
  - **Mene (60 shekels) = 1,200 gerahs**
  - **Tekel (1 shekel) = 20 gerahs**
  - **Peres (30 shekels) = 600 gerahs**

And for the Beast:

- **600 shekels = 12,000 gerahs**
- **60 shekels = 1,200 gerahs**
- **6 shekels = 120 gerahs**

### Judgment Scene (in Gerahs)

| Judgment Scene           | Mene (Numbered) | Tekel (Weighed) | Peres (Divided) |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Daniel 5 (Belshazzar)**| 1,200 gerahs     | 20 gerahs       | 600 gerahs       |
| **Revelation 13 (Beast)**| 12,000 gerahs    | 1,200 gerahs    | 120 gerahs       |


A **gerah** is the smallest biblical unit of weight--1/20th of a shekel.  
It was used in precise valuations for offerings and redemption.  
In Exodus 30:13, each man paid **10 gerahs** (half a shekel) as an **atonement price** during the census.  
This ties the gerah directly to the value of a soul and makes it a key unit in divine accounting.

### Multiplying the Weighed and the Divided

| Judgment Scene           | Mene (Numbered) | Tekel (Weighed) | Peres (Divided) |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Daniel 5 (Belshazzar)**| 1,200 gerahs     | 20 gerahs       | 600 gerahs       |
| **Revelation 13 (Beast)**| 12,000 gerahs    | 1,200 gerahs    | 120 gerahs       |

**IMPORTANT**

Multiply **Weighed** x **Divided** for both Daniel 5 (Belshazzar) and Revelation 13 (the Beast):

- **20 x 600 = 12,000**  
- **1,200 x 120 = 144,000**

These results aren't random. They match exactly with the **tribal structure of Israel** in Revelation:

- **12,000 per tribe** x 12 = **144,000**

This confirms that the **Weighed and Divided values are not just symbolic--they are directly tied to inheritance and judgment in favor of Israel**.

Multiplication effectively reverses the act of division, allowing us to reconstruct the original grouped quantity--and what is now being **transferred or stripped**.

The values in Gerahs imply a process having to do with redemption. The **144,000** recieve the kingdom of the beast (Revelation 11:15, Luke 12:32, Revelation 2:27). This is implied in the framework: "Divided" is that which is given to another kingdom. In this case, the kingdom of the world goes to the elect. 

See the Process--Converted to Minas

| Judgment Scene            | Mene (Numbered)  | Tekel (Weighed)      | Peres (Divided)       |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Daniel 5 (Belshazzar)** | 1 mina           | 1/60 mina (1 shekel)  | 1/2 mina               |
| **Revelation 13 (Beast)** | 10 minas         | 1 mina                | 1/10 mina (6 shekels)  |

The **mina** (as shown further in the study below) is directly associated with **rulership**--over kingdoms or cities.  
So in this comparison:

- **Babylon** is assigned **1 mina**.
- The **Beast's kingdom** is assigned **10 minas**, which corresponds to **10 kings** or **10 stewards**.

This directly aligns with the symbolic **10 horns** of the Beast:

> **Revelation 13:1**  
> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea,  
> having seven heads and **ten horns**, and upon his horns **ten crowns**,  
> and upon his heads the **name of blasphemy**.

### Counting the Number, Identifying the Man

"Let him that hath understanding **count the number of the beast**: for it is the number of **a man**; "

We have shown the method of how it the number is counted, and the system at work, but can we "count the number of the beast", or identify "the man"? 

> **Psalms 90:12** - So teach us to **number our days**, that we may **apply our hearts unto wisdom**. 

This scripture, Psalms 90:12 fits the subject well, if you read the entire context: https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-90-12/

It is better not to presume to say what has been counted or named, but rather we have identified the system wherein it is done. God alone knows the hearts and weighs the spirits. He is our life, and length of our days. 

> **Job 3:16** - Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. 

### Numerical Confirmation from 144,000 and 666

**NOTICE** 144,000 / 6 / 6 / 6 = 666.666... Or 144000 / 6^3 = 666.666...

This is not numerology--it's a verification of correlation. In mathematical terms, this shows that **144,000 and 666 are not just symbolically related--they are functionally scaled**.

- **144,000** is the inheritance of the righteous in Revelation (12,000 per tribe).
- **666** is the judgment number of the Beast.
- The result--**666.666...**--reveals a direct link between the final number of the faithful and the full exposure of the unfaithful.

This shows that divine judgment operates with **mathematical precision**--both in reward and in stripping. The same measuring system governs both the condemnation of the Beast and the glorification of the faithful.

## The Study, The Explanation 

That was a lot of numbers--but unlike [numerology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology), [gematria](https://www.gematrix.org/), or other [speculative interpretations of 666](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_beast), this approach relies on **strict scriptural connections** and consistent biblical weights. Given both the relevance of the math and its direct context, coincidence is ruled out.

### The Faithful Stewards, the Evil Steward

The event of **The Beast** and the fall of **Babylon** are direct examples of the **evil servant** being judged. Their **division** is echoed in scripture:

> **Matthew 24:45-51**  
> Who then is a **faithful and wise servant**, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  
> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  
> Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him **ruler over all his goods**.  
> But and if that **evil servant** shall say in his heart, **My lord delayeth his coming;**  
> And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  
> The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  
> And shall **cut him asunder**, and appoint him his **portion with the hypocrites**: there shall be **weeping and gnashing of teeth**.

**NOTE** "cut him asunder", or divide up (his kingdom).

Compare this to:

> **Psalm 50:22**  
> Now consider this, **ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces**, and there be none to deliver.

But the **judgment formula**--**Counted, Weighed, Divided**--is also applied to **faithful and unfaithful stewards** in Jesus' parables:

---

### The Parable of the Minas (Luke 19:12-27)

| Principle      | Action Shown                                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Counted**    | Each of 10 servants receives **1 mina** (10 total)         |
| **Weighed**    | Each servant's **return is evaluated** (some 10x, some 5x, one 0x) |
| **Divided**    | The unfaithful servant's mina is **taken and given** to the most fruitful one (who now has 10) |

> "Take from him the mina, and give it to the one who has ten."

---

### The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30)

| Principle      | Action Shown                                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Counted**    | Three servants are given **measured talents** (5, 2, 1)    |
| **Weighed**    | Their **stewardship is judged**--returns are calculated     |
| **Divided**    | The idle servant's **1 talent is taken and given** to the one with 10 |

> "Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents."

---

### Summary

In both parables:

- The **resources are counted** and distributed.  
- Stewardship is **weighed** through productivity or negligence.  
- Then the result is **divided**--the unfaithful are stripped, and the faithful **inherit what was lost**.

This perfectly mirrors the **Mene, Tekel, Peres** structure:

| Word   | Meaning   | Stewardship Parallel            |
|--------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Mene   | Counted   | Resources assigned               |
| Tekel  | Weighed   | Person assessed             |
| Peres  | Divided   | Reward or judgment administered  |

Thus, whether in prophecy or parable, **divine judgment follows the same mathematical audit: Counted -> Weighed -> Divided.**

## Verses Connecting to this Theme 

## Scriptures on the Transfer of Wealth from the Wicked to the Righteous

> **Proverbs 13:22**  
> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:  
> and the **wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just**.

> **Ecclesiastes 2:26**

> which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth:  
> and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.  
> **Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton...**

---

Each of these passages reinforces the theme of **divine reversal**—where the wealth accumulated unjustly by the wicked is eventually transferred to the faithful, either as **judgment** or as a form of **righteous inheritance**. This principle is central to the *Counted -> Weighed -> Divided* structure and is reflected in the fate of Belshazzar, the Beast, and the unfaithful stewards in Jesus' parables.
