# 666 Decoded: How Daniel's Judgment Formula Exposes the Beast 

This isn't numerology. It's divine accounting.
666 isn't a mystery number--it's a verdict. The Beast was judged with the same prophetic formula used on Belshazzar in Daniel 5. Here's how it all adds up.

## What You're About to Read:
This is a full breakdown of the **Counted** -> **Weighed** -> **Divided** system revealed in Daniel 5 and echoed in Revelation. Using consistent biblical weights (minas, shekels, gerahs), we show how *666 is not mystical*--it's a **prophetic accounting formula** tied to **divine judgment** and **inheritance**.
We'll demonstrate how the Beast is judged like Belshazzar, how the 10 horns match the 10 minas (600 Shekels), and how faithful stewards (**144,000**) inherit what is stripped from the wicked. 

## How to Count the Beast's Number

### The Weights, Measures, and Monetary Standard

> **Ezekiel 45:12** - And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

From this, we learn the standard biblical weights:

- **1 Mina (Maneh) = 60 Shekels**  
- **1 Shekel = 20 Gerahs**

This is the foundational key for decoding 666. The number must be interpreted using these divine weights--not modern assumptions.
