# What is Divine Inspiration and How Can You Recognize It?

Inspiration is a vaguely understood concept among most Christians. However, it is seen in scripture that the world is completely immersed in inspiration. Once you see the various clues as to what inspiration is, you will gain a new and higher respect for what this life is, and more importantly, the one who gives all life.

## What we will cover here:

- What is inspiration?
- How can you recognize God's inspiration?
- How can you recognize the inspiration of darkness? [Quran, Book of Mormon, etc]

## Divine Inspiration is Life Itself, and God Himself

I will start with The Wisdom of Solomon, speaking against idolaters:

> **Wisdom [15:11]** Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that **inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.**

This matches what is said in Genesis: 

> **Genesis [2:7]** And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

### An Important Definition on Inspiration

> In Hebrew, the word most closely related to this concept is רוּחַ (ruach), which means **"breath," "spirit," or "wind."** The idea is that God's breath (His spirit) **inspires and animates**. In Genesis 2:7, God breathes the breath of life into Adam, signifying the life-giving power of His spirit.

### The Power of Life

Divine inspiration is first of all Life. Jesus calls himself the Life: 

> **John [14:6]** Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

It is important to note that Jesus gives himself important titles, which, he being the Word, are necessary to finding equivalences in the written Word, or the Scriptures.

For example, in the statement "I am the way, the truth, and the life," we see that Jesus = The Way = Truth = Life.

This means that these three things are associated with divine inspiration—divine inspiration being the power that drives life.

Two more associations with inspiration:

> **2 Timothy [3:16]** All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness...

### The Light of Life, a Synonym to Inspiration

> **John [1:9]** That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

We know from the scriptures above that the spirit God gives (the breath, the inspiration) brings us to life. Here we see an extension of the concept: He is the light that activates our life. So the two are likely the same—a living, illuminated spirit. Though it seems strange to connect the two concepts, they are easily connected in the spiritual world:

> **Hebrews [1:7]** And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his **angels spirits**, and his **ministers a flame of fire**. [ie, a light]

And a further connection of inspiration to light, there is this verse which we will again touch on: 

> **Isaiah [8:19-20]** And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?
> 
> To the law and to the testimony: **if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.** [This is a supremely important concept. We will return to it.]

Our world is a struggle between life and death, and the battleground of this struggle is mostly in the word itself. This is why one must understand that life itself begins and ends with the Word, and inspiration is what keeps us alive, gives us speech, and so forth.

> **Acts [17:28]** For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.

## How Can You Recognize God's Inspiration?

If you review the above introduction, the remaining logic is easy. 

> **Proverbs [1:23]** Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my **spirit** unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

This has a double meaning. God's own words will become apparent to you when you see them, besides that your life will be increased.

Compare:

> **John [10:10]** I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

How do we make this connection? Because Jesus is life, life is inspiration, and when life (inspiration) is given by the Word of God (Jesus), His words become apparent to you, and the words that are not His are seen as lifeless. Hence, you can make a distinction.

A reminder of the above scripture:

> **if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.** [ie, they are lifeless, the inspiration of death]

Christians will commonly tell you a simple answer if you ask them, "How do you know if something is inspired by God?" 

Some will say, "If it is in the Bible!" 

Others will say, "Inspired words always agree with God..." 

And while this is partly true, it is not the formula. The formula is that inspiration is known by inspiration. 

> **1 Corinthians [2:11]** For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.

This here clearly tells us that we cannot determine an inspired saying except that God inspires the understanding.

In agreement with this:

> **Proverbs [8:14-17]** Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: **I am understanding**; I have strength. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 

So to put it simply, **inspiration is known by inspiration**. Those who belong to God have varying powers of inspiration and different gifts that make them unique in this life.

## How Can You Recognize the Inspiration of Darkness? [Quran, Book of Mormon, etc]

There is inspiration everywhere, even dark inspiration. The inspiration of death is everywhere to be found in human society.

The long-lasting texts of evil inspiration are powerful and cunning because they come from the minds of fallen angels acting upon man.

So let us start with the Quran. Note: When I examined the Quran after prayer, I found this interesting connection to the darkness:

Regarding the plagues of Egypt, the Quran states:

> "Indeed, **We afflicted** the Pharaoh and his people with years of drought and scarcity of fruit, so they might take heed. But whenever good came to them, they would say: 'This is our due.'

But the Psalms (the inspired scripture) states that this was accomplished by **evil angels**. 

> **Psalms [78:49]** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by **sending evil angels among them**.

So in the Quran, the angel (purporting to be Gabriel) says "We afflicted," whereas the inspired scripture states that evil angels afflicted Pharaoh and his people. Therefore, the Quran was given by evil angels.

Now, it's common that if a person does not agree with a scripture connection, a debate of words and translation should ensue, so that meaning can be forced. But this is not necessary here. Why?

Who is a sworn common enemy of Jews and Christians? The Muslim religion.

Thus, it is most certainly controlled by the "evil angels" or the principalities of darkness.

While a Muslim might argue that "We" refers to God, that is merely a wishful interpretation. In inspired scripture, "We" is used rarely in reference to God ("Let Us create man"); rather, God most often speaks using "I." However, in the Quran, the identity of the speaker is easily assigned to the angel purporting to be Gabriel and his "evil angel" companions. "We".

Of course, the Quran attacks Jesus' Godship / Messiahship directly, but this is commonly explained among Christian apologists.

Dark inspiration. NOT inspired from God. Sayings of death, evil, and not the Way of Life. 

### The Book of Mormon 

Closer to home, we have one of the greatest and most obnoxious abominations to come out of America's freedom of religion: The Book of Mormon.

This one is even easier.

> **Galatians [1:8-9]** But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.

The Bible tells us that if ANYONE brings another gospel, not of Jesus, then let that man or angel be accursed.

Meanwhile, the book of Mormon's title (the MAN who wrote it Joseph Smith, the ANGEL who inspired it "Moroni") is titled this: 

The Book of Mormon: **Another** Testament of Jesus Christ

The man, the angel, the contrary gospel. All there, just like the Book of Galatians warned. And that is just the title and main context of the book!

These things aren't hard. 

## Evil Inspiration in Scientism 

Watch this famous commentary by Neil deGrasse Tyson...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PEKppz5cgw

Here you can see/hear Neil deGrasse Tyson flaunting human observations and claims over God's wisdom. He effectively states that highly intelligent thinkers have ruled out biblical matters from what they daily observe. "Science right. God wrong."

And while volumes could be written on this foolishness (a mere main standing up in his vain and self-righteous stance speaking out against his own maker) one can easily conclude this in Job:

> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath **stretched the line upon it**?

Here we see "the line" denoting a flat earth being mapped as by a surveyor. One does not stretch out the line on a "globe". Scientists are fools.

But all arguments aside: This person, like all who follow him, will have to answer to the one who made him. They will see that they spoke under dark inspiration, and as such, have been delivered over to the darkness that they loved so much.

Now if you appreciate inspiration, which is the power of life and existence itself (indeed, we speak of Jesus himself in such a thing), then it is easy to dismiss scientism and the fools we call scientists, because they constantly contradict and dismiss the cause of their own life and the world they temporarily and ungratefully inhabit.

> **1 Timothy [6:19-21]** Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, **avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: Which some professing have erred concerning the faith**. Grace be with thee. Amen.
