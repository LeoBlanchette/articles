# THE LAW and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil 

The article that follows is a **magnificent revelation**. It is not commonly known. It will increase your understanding of what the **New Covenant** has saved us from, and how **deadly** the **Old Covenant** can be to those who take it up without qualification.

This article presents a concept without embellishment, offering a revelation that's often overlooked. It rigorously compares scriptures, and is not merely an exposition. 

While comparisons between the Law of Moses and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil have been made before, this review shows that they can be considered the same thing. 

## The Food / Doctrine Principle 

The scriptures are expressed heavily in parables. Events that occurred in real life became parables in hindsight (Galatians 4:24). This means that events that we read of provide both literal and figurative meanings, with the figurative having more weight -- we would say these are *"spiritual"* meanings. 

In scripture, however, **FOOD = DOCTRINE** in symbolism. 

This will be important in considering the tree that Adam and Eve ate from. 

### Food = Doctrine Examples 

> Matthew 16:11-12 - How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? Then understood they how that **he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees**.

In a deeper thread, but consistent with symbolism:

**JESUS = THE WORD** (John 1:14)  
**JESUS = BREAD / WINE** (John 6:54-58)

The **WORD** is **FOOD** to be **LEARNED**, as *doctrine* is *food* and *eating* becomes *learning*. 

## Judging Similitudes: Tree of Life (Jesus) & Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (The Law)

A crucial principle of comparison we'll employ in this study is based on the weight and authority of chief elements. We hold that there cannot be multiple, distinct versions of the same core element. Instead, elements of lesser authority or weight serve as representations of the chief elements, meaning they are fundamentally the same concept expressed in different forms.

## The Two Trees

So here are the core symbolisms first. 

![Jesus = Tree of Life; Moses = Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil](images/old-new-covenant-trees.png)


### JESUS = THE LIFE 

> John 14:6 - Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and **the life**: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

There is an important principle where the reality outweighs the symbol, and the symbol points to the reality. 

It can be seen here: 

> John 6:32-33 - Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, **Moses gave you not that bread from heaven**; but my Father giveth you **the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.**

So the spiritual reality is observed greater than the physical occurrence / symbol. 

Of special note is the association with manna with the Law of Moses and Angel's Food (food = doctrine):

> Psalm 78:25 - Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

Compare: 

> Deuteronomy 8:3 - And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with **manna**, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that **man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.**

And so we see a repetition: The **manna**'s symbolism represents **the Word**, and the Word is the reality of the symbol, to be taken as having higher authority and literalism. In this case, we see Moses compare manna to the Word, and later the Word is Jesus. Therefore **manna = Jesus**. But the manna was not the literal life giving food, as it is plainly stated later that those who ate of the manna died (John 6:49-51). So there was no life giving quality to the actual symbolic physical element, but rather the reality of the-giving power was in the Word itself. 

With this strong principle applied, **The Tree of Life** must represent Jesus the same as the Manna did. This is because Jesus equated himself with **Life**. Therefor there **cannot be two separate entities which are a source of life**, but rather just one entity, with the lesser symbol pointing to the greater.

### The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil 

It is easy to identify Jesus as the tree of life, as he's also likened himself to a vine with branches. In light of the few proofs shown, we can confidently say that Jesus is the Tree of Life. (This does not negate the reality that Adam and Eve were exposed to and at from literal trees, any more than Jesus negates the manna that fed the people.)

**If Jesus is the Tree of Life, then what is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil?** 

Simple thinking would lead us to say that "it must be the opposite of Jesus! It must be Satan!" or something similar. However we know that the Original Serpent was associated with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, decieving Eve to eat from it. 

We will see many proofs harmonizing **the Law** with **the Tree**. 

#### Moses Connects the Tree with the Law 

Here Moses speaks of the Law:

> Deuteronomy 30:15 - See, I have set before thee this day life and **good**, and death and **evil**;

So apart from the tree, the OTHER entity containing **the knowledge of evil** is **The Law**. Based on the much further evidence to come, we can unite these two concepts to say this: 

Just as the Tree of Life represented Jesus, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil represent the law. 

### Scripture Comparisons Uniting the Law with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil 

![The Knowledge of Good and Evil](images/the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil.png)

#### Became Gods 

This is the first and most binding proof that the Tree and the Law are the same: 

> John 10:35 - If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

Jesus here refers to the Written Law (**Scripture**)

Compare to: 

> Genesis 3:5,22, - [5] For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and **ye shall be as gods**, knowing good and evil. [22] And the Lord God said, Behold, the **man is become as one of us**, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 

So do BOTH the TREE and THE LAW have the same power of turning man into gods? It is more logical to say that just one thing has this power: *The Law* (**Angel's Food**).

#### Eyes Opened, Knowing Sin
